# 🏔️ Engineering Excellence

 I am pursuing mechanical engineering while currently refurbishing my deskdop computer. I currently work at fedex ground pursuing a operations manager position on the side of my college education. I also enjoy mountaineering, primarily hiking in the adirondack mountains but hoping to explore more.
